									<h4>EXCELLENCE</h4>
									<p>
										Excellence for ADAMS means pleasing Allah by providing services above people’s expectation, delivering service with speed, treating people
										(staff, volunteers, members and stakeholders in general) with the utmost respect, running an efficient administration with up-to-date
										management systems and technology and well-trained staff, and promptly conducting beneficial programs that are well thought out and well
										prepared for, and maintaining facilities and grounds to the highest standard of functionality, cleanliness, and physical appearance.

								<div class="content">
									<h4>INTEGRITY</h4>
									<p>
										As an Islamic organization, to ADAMS integrity means adherence to Islamic ethics and principles, which include fairness, honesty, delivering
										on promises, and matching words and beliefs with deeds and actions. Integrity is achieved when serious thought is given to the question
										“what is the right thing to do,” which must be asked and answered by all levels of the organization while referring back to sound Board
										policies and well-designed administrative procedures, and by means of consultation within the organization, and by considering stakeholders’
										input and feedback.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-12">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>TRANSPARENCY</h4>
									<p>
										Transparency generally implies openness, communication, and accountability. It is a metaphorical extension of the meaning that a
										“transparent” object is one that can be seen through. Transparent procedures include open meetings, financial disclosure statements, freedom
										of information, budgetary review and audits, etc.

							<h1>OUR PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE</h1>
							<p>
								In 1983, a small group of families in Herndon and Reston, Virginia established the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center to serve the local
								Muslim population. Over the past three decades, the ADAMS Center has grown into one of the largest Muslim communities in the Washington, D.C. area.
								Today, we serve the areas of Sterling, Ashburn, Centerville, Chantilly, Gainesville, Great Falls Herndon, Leesburg, McLean, and Reston, in northern
								Virginia. Our community continues to grow each year as more families join us.
							</p>
							<p>
								At the ADAMS Center, our greatest pride is in education, community and youth development, and service. We organize a variety of educational and
								social
								activities and gatherings that provide the children, youth, and families with wonderful opportunities to learn and grow as brothers and sisters in
								faith. The ADAMS Center also believes in interfaith collaboration and as a result, we host and participate in several interdenominational programs
								and
								activities throughout the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

							The ADAMS Center Sunday School Program was established specifically for building Muslim character, strong faith, and proper knowledge of Islamic beliefs
							and rituals, as embodied in the Qur’an and the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him). The ADAMS Center is a non-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3)
							corporation registered in the State of Virginia. ADAMS Center has grown since its foundation in 1983. ADAMS now proudly serves thousands of families
							throughout northern Virginia.
						</p>
						<p>
							A professional staff of 25 members manage the ADAMS Center and an elected Executive Committee provides oversight on the organization. The Executive
							Committee routinely reports to the Board of Trustees, which consists of 13 elected members from various backgrounds. The ADAMS Center’s main campus is
							located in Sterling, Virginia on Sugarland Road. The campus has 25,000 square feet and a mosque that can accommodate over 700 attendees, weekend school
							for children and youth, and a community multi-purpose hall and gymnasium. An expansion plan is underway on the main campus to match the needs of the
							rapidly growing community. We also have two full-service ADAMS Center campuses in Ashburn and Chantilly, Virginia as well as six satellite campuses,
							which are located along the Route 267 and Route 28 corridors. These satellite sites specifically run Friday prayers. A full-service ADAMS Center campus
							in Gainesville, Virginia is currently in development.
