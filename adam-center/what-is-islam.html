							Over the past three decades, the ADAMS Center has grown into one of the largest Muslim communities in the Washington, D.C. area. Today, we serve the
							areas of Sterling, Ashburn, Centerville, Chantilly, Gainesville, Great Falls, Herndon, Leesburg, McLean, and Reston, in northern Virginia. Our community
							continues to grow each year as more families join us.

								“Say, ‘The truth is that Allah is One. Allah is Besought of all, needing none. He neither begets nor is begotten, Nor is there to Him an
								equivalent.’” (112:1-4)
							</p>
							<p>
								God is the One, the indivisible. He is Eternal and Absolute, He Who created all and was created by none; upon Whom all depend while He depends on
								none. He is the Self-Sufficient,
								the Provider. He does not beget, nor was He begotten, nor does He share a partner in His Divine majesty. He Who cannot be known by the eyes, He who
								is unlike anything, nothing is
								like him, and He is aware of all things.
							</p>
							<p>
								God is the Absolute in knowledge: nothing is hidden from Him, and yet He is hidden from everything. He beholds all and hears all: from the smallest
								particle in the smallest atom to
								the supernovas that disrupt the heavens – He is aware of all things and in Absolute control.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-12">
					<p>
						God is the Absolute in power: nothing transpires except that He allows it, and nothing exists except that He creates it. It is He Who creates by the word
						“Be,” and where there was nothing becomes something. He Who is unlimited by time or space, transcendent beyond limitation – for it is He Who created all
						limitations. God is Allah – the name that He has chosen for Himself. It is the name He revealed in His final revelation – the name that denotes all that was
						mentioned above. Allah is the One,
						the Indivisible. He is the Almighty, the All-Knowing. One who believes this about God has believed in Allah.
					</p>
					<p>
						Praise be to the One, the Absolute; the Transcendent, the Eternal; the First and the Last, the Immense, the Majestic; The Merciful, the Compassionate; the
						All-Knowing, the Just. Praise be to Allah, the Creator of all things, and the One Who controls the possibility of all things.

							“O mankind, there has come to you a conclusive proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light.” (4:174)
						</p>
						<p>
							The Qur’an is the meticulously preserved uncreated spoken word of God, given to the archangel Gabriel (Jibril) and revealed to the final prophet of God,
							peace and blessings of
							Allah be upon him. It is the final revelation to humankind, the last of the divine scripture, the final communication of God.

						<p>
							The Qur’an affirms what came before it in the Torah and Gospel, corrects that which was changed, and clarifies that which was misunderstood. It warns of
							the last day, threatens the
							fire, and give glad-tidings of paradise. It is the guide to the pleasure of God, the criterion between right and wrong, the unwavering light in the
							hearts of believers.

							<p>
								“The Day they come forth nothing concerning them will be concealed from Allah. To whom belongs [all] sovereignty this Day? To Allah, the One, the
								Prevailing. This Day every soul
								will be recompensed for what it earned. No injustice today! Indeed, Allah is swift in account.” (40:16-17)
							</p>
							<p>
								God has decreed accountability on all people: those who do good are rewarded for their good, and those who do evil are given their just deserts. The
								fires are burned with
								increasing intensity for the evil-doers; the gardens are beautified for the doers of good. A single trumpet signals the end of time. All have
								perished except for He Whose Divine
								Face is eternal. Then He Who created humankind will create it again: they are all gathered together for the account of their deeds.

						The book of deeds will be opened for them, with each action in each moment recorded therein. It descends from the right for those with shining faces; it
						descends from the left for
						those who tremble in terror before their Divine Lord. The book is opened; the account is begun. Read! Be sufficed today in this, your account. They struggle
						in vain those whose
						scale is weighed heavily by evil. Take them, O angels, by their foreheads! Clasp their hands; tie their arms. Drag them willingly or unwillingly to the
						depths of the flames.
						Eternal is their abode therein: consequence for the evil which was wrought.
					</p>
					<p>
						They rejoice in glee those whose scales are weighed heavily by good. Wrap them in garments of paradise; perfume them in the scent of bliss. Greet them, O
						angels, at the gates of
						heaven. Eternal is their abode therein: reward for the good which they have sown.
					</p>
					<p>
						Praise be to Him Who created the gardens and the flames. We beseech Him to enter us into His paradise, to save use from His punishment, and protect us and
						our progeny from the evil
						of our own hands.

								“He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon

							“Say, [O believers], ‘We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob
							and the Descendants and what
							was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in

						</p>
						<p>
							Praise be to the One Who created humankind and sent to them messengers and prophets to guide them to love Him. He did not leave humanity without
							guidance: indeed, He sent to them
							messengers from amongst themselves to guide them on their journey to know and love Him and He desires of them. Abraham, Moses, and Jesus are among the
							greatest of God’s messengers.
							Abraham, the survivor of flames; Moses, the splitter of seas; Jesus, the raiser of dead: they are His obedient servants and gifts from Him to all of

							people the love of God and taught them to seek His pleasure. Peace and blessings be upon them all: human in their entirety, but raised above all else in
