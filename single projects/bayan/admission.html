					<p>Islamic education at Bayan aims to impart knowledge of the Holy Quran and provide opportunities
						for experiential learning of Islam as outlined in the Holy Quran and Sunnah.</p>
					<p>The process of education should be continuous and never-ending; it should meet both the spiritual
						as well as the material needs of the individual; it should inculcate the belief in Islam in the
						minds and hearts of the individual; it should promote morality based on the Islamic faith; it
						should encourage the individual to acquire knowledge for daily use; it should develop a quest
						for the acquisition of knowledge; it should aim to provide experiences in the form of knowledge
						and skills with clear understanding that these experiences are likely to be changed in the light
						of changes in society; it should account for a deep understanding of all theological narratives.
					</p>
					<p>Those are the aims and objectives of the curriculum at Bayan.</p>
